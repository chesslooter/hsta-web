# HSTA
Developed for CS 506 at The University of Wisconsin-Madison

#Desktop Side
Navigate to ~\HSTA\desktop\HSDesktopClient and run npm install to update dependencies after every pull
In general this shouldn't change, but should help reduce any issues we have between computers

We will be branching shortly to differentiate between PC and Mac - this makes a difference with Electron.

#Testing
Testing for all non-electron required portions can be done with ng serve, after navigating to ~\HSTA\desktop\HSDesktopClient. This opens a window in browser on http://localhost:4200/ where testing can be done. 
All changes are automatically recompiled after changes are saved, so ng serve can remain on while changes are made - there is no need to stop and start when modifying.

Contact Jake on Discord with any build questions, especially early on in the build.
